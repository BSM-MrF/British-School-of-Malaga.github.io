# Composite Data Types

Composite data types are types that can hold multiple pieces of data together. They are like containers that can store different values of different types as a single entity.

Think of a composite data type as a bag that can hold various items. Each item in the bag can be of a different type, such as numbers, strings, or even other composite data types. These composite data types allow you to organize and group related data together, making it easier to work with and manipulate complex structures.

There are different forms of composite data types, such as arrays, structures, and classes.

- Arrays are an ordered collection of elements of the same type. They allow you to store multiple values of the same data type, such as a list of numbers or a series of names.

- Structures (or records) are a way to combine different types of data into a single entity. For example, you can have a structure that represents a person, with fields like name, age, and address.

- Classes are a more advanced form of composite data types, often used in object-oriented programming. They encapsulate both data and functions, allowing you to create objects with their own unique properties and behaviors.

Composite data types are essential in programming as they enable you to model and manipulate complex real-world concepts and relationships. They provide a way to organize and represent data in a structured manner, making code more efficient, modular, and easier to understand and maintain.
