# Classes

In computer science, classes are fundamental building blocks of object-oriented programming (OOP). They allow us to define our own user-defined data types, known as objects, which encapsulate data and the operations that can be performed on that data. In this class, we will explore the concepts of classes, creating classes in Python, and important concepts like inheritance and polymorphism.

## Understanding Classes:
A class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of objects that can be created from it. It serves as a blueprint for creating multiple instances of similar objects. Each object created from a class is called an instance or an object. The attributes represent the state of an object, while methods define the behaviors or actions that an object can perform.

## Creating a Class in Python:
In Python, we can define a class using the `class` keyword followed by the name of the class. Let's take a look at the basic syntax for creating a class:

```python
class ClassName:
    # Class attributes (optional)

    def __init__(self, parameters):
        # Constructor method (optional)
        # Initializes the attributes of an object

    def method1(self, parameters):
        # Method definition

    def method2(self, parameters):
        # Method definition

# Create an instance of the class
object_name = ClassName(arguments)
```

## Inheritance:
Inheritance is a powerful concept in OOP that allows us to define a new class (child class) based on an existing class (parent class). The child class inherits the attributes and methods of the parent class, and it can also add new attributes or override existing methods. Inheritance promotes code reusability and allows us to create specialized classes from more general ones.

To define a child class that inherits from a parent class, we use the following syntax:

```python
class ChildClass(ParentClass):
    # Child class attributes and methods
```

### Example:

Here is an example showing how to create the initial class for a person in a school:

Start by creating a class called `Person` as the base class for all individuals in the school. Discuss with the students the common properties that every person in the school would have, such as `name` and `date_of_birth`. Here's an example code snippet to create the `Person` class:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, date_of_birth, activity):
        self.name = name
        self.date_of_birth = date_of_birth
```


This initial class can be used as a blueprint for further classes.
Lets uses the person class as the base for classes for different people in a school. There are teachers, students and other members of staff.

Create a `Student` class that inherits from the `Person` class. The `Student` class can add its own specific attributes, such as `grade` or `student_ID`. Here's an example code snippet:

```python
class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, date_of_birth, ID, grade, student_ID):
        super().__init__(name, date_of_birth, ID)
        self.grade = grade
        self.student_ID = student_ID
```

## Polymorphism:
Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method name. It allows us to use a single interface or method to represent different forms or behaviors. Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading.

- Method Overriding: In method overriding, a child class provides a different implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. The method in the child class overrides the method with the same name in the parent class. This allows the child class to change or extend the behavior of the inherited method.

- Method Overloading (not available in Python): Method overloading refers to defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. However, Python does not support method overloading based on different parameter types. It uses a concept called "duck typing," where the behavior of a method is determined by the object's attributes and methods rather than the method's signature.

Understanding classes and object-oriented programming is crucial for building complex and scalable software systems. By creating classes in Python, leveraging inheritance, and utilizing polymorphism, we can design more modular, reusable, and maintainable code. Now that you have a basic understanding of classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, let's dive into some examples and exercises to solidify your knowledge.
