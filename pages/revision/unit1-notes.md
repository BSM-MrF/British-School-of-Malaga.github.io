# 1 Types and components of computer systems

Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system, including internal components such as the Central Processing Unit (CPU), processor, motherboard, and internal memory, including random access memory (RAM) and read-only memory (ROM). It also includes hardware components such as graphics cards, sound cards, Network Interface Cards (NIC), cameras, internal and external storage devices, as well as input and output devices like keyboards, mice, and monitors.

Software, on the other hand, refers to programs that control the operation of a computer or process electronic data. Applications software provides users with the necessary tools to perform specific tasks, such as word processing, spreadsheet management, database management, video and audio editing, and computer-aided design. System software, on the other hand, provides the necessary services for a computer to operate, including compilers, linkers, device drivers, operating systems, and utilities.

Analogue data refers to continuous signals that can vary in amplitude and frequency, such as sound or temperature, whereas digital data refers to discrete, binary signals that are either "on" or "off" and have precise values, such as numerical data. Analog data is typically represented as a wave, while digital data is represented as a series of 1s and 0s. The differences between analogue and digital data include their characteristics, such as precision, accuracy, and noise susceptibility. To process analogue data, it needs to be converted into digital data using an analogue-to-digital converter (ADC), while digital data may need to be converted to analogue data using a digital-to-analogue converter (DAC) to control devices like speakers or motors.

## Hardware:

### Internal Components

The internal components of a computer are the parts that are located inside the computer case, and they perform various functions to allow the computer to operate. The three main internal components of a computer are the Central Processing Unit (CPU), processor, and motherboard.

The **CPU** , or **Central**** Processing ****Unit** , is the primary component of a computer system responsible for executing instructions. It is often referred to as the "brain" of the computer, as it performs all the processing required for the computer to function. It performs most of the calculations and operations that a computer needs to run. It controls the flow of data within the computer and executes the instructions of the software programs that run on the computer.

The role of the CPU is to process instructions entered into the computer in order to produce an output. The CPU performs three main tasks: fetch, decode, and execute.

First, the CPU fetches the instructions from memory, where they are stored. It then decodes the instructions, determining what operation needs to be performed. Finally, it executes the instruction, performing the necessary calculations and storing the result back in memory.

The CPU works in conjunction with other components of the computer system, such as memory and input/output devices, to process data and perform tasks. When a user enters input, such as typing on a keyboard or clicking a mouse, the input is sent to the CPU, which then processes the information and sends output to the appropriate output device, such as a monitor or printer.

The **motherboard** is the main circuit board of the computer, and it connects all of the internal components together. It provides the electrical connections and pathways for the various parts of the computer to communicate with each other.

#### Memory:

Internal memory is a crucial part of a computer system, as it is used to store and access data and programs that are currently being used by the computer. There are several types of internal memory, including Random Access Memory (RAM), Read-Only Memory (ROM), and Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS).

**RAM** is a type of volatile memory that is used by the computer to store data and programs that are currently in use. When the computer is turned off, the data stored in RAM is lost. The main purpose of RAM is to provide fast and efficient access to data and programs that the computer is currently using. Examples of programs that use RAM include web browsers, word processors, and image editing software.

**ROM** , on the other hand, is a type of non-volatile memory that is used to store data and programs that are needed to start up and run the computer. Unlike RAM, the data stored in ROM is not lost when the computer is turned off. Examples of data stored in ROM include the computer's BIOS, which contains the instructions necessary to boot up the computer, and firmware for various hardware components, such as the graphics card.

**CMOS** is a type of non-volatile memory that is used to store the settings and configuration data for the computer's BIOS. This includes information such as the date and time, boot order, and system settings. CMOS uses a small battery to retain this information even when the computer is turned off.

Overall, internal memory plays a critical role in the operation of a computer system, allowing for the storage and retrieval of data and programs necessary for the computer to function. RAM provides temporary storage for programs and data currently in use, while ROM and CMOS provide permanent storage for essential system data and settings.

### Hardware components:

#### Storage:

Internal and External Storage Devices: Internal storage devices are hardware components that are installed inside a computer and are used to store data, such as documents, photos, and videos. Common types of internal storage devices include hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs). External storage devices, on the other hand, are hardware components that are connected to a computer via USB or another interface and are used to store data. Common types of external storage devices include USB flash drives, external hard drives, and optical discs like CDs and DVDs.

**Back-up storage,** also known as secondary storage, is used to store data and programs for long-term use. Unlike internal memory (RAM), which is volatile and can only hold data temporarily, backing storage is non-volatile and can hold data even when the computer is turned off.

There are different types of backing storage devices, such as hard disk drives, solid-state drives, optical discs, and USB flash drives, each with their own characteristics. These devices can vary in terms of their capacity, access speed, portability, durability, and cost.

One of the main differences between backing storage and internal memory is their speed. Internal memory (RAM) is much faster than backing storage, as it is directly connected to the CPU and can be accessed quickly. Backing storage devices, on the other hand, are slower, as they are connected to the computer via an input/output (I/O) controller.

##### HDDs

A hard disk drive (HDD) is a type of internal storage device that is used to store data on a computer. HDDs consist of a spinning disk that is coated with a magnetic material, and a read/write head that moves over the disk to read and write data.

When data is written to an HDD, the read/write head magnetizes tiny areas on the disk to represent the 1s and 0s of binary data. These magnetic areas are arranged in concentric circles called tracks, and each track is divided into sectors, which are the smallest addressable units of data on the disk.

When data is read from an HDD, the read/write head detects the magnetic fields on the disk and converts them into electrical signals that are then sent to the computer's processor. The processor interprets the signals as data and uses it to perform tasks or display information on the computer screen.

One of the key features of HDDs is their rotational speed, measured in revolutions per minute (RPM). The faster the disk spins, the faster data can be read and written to the disk. However, faster spinning disks also generate more heat and consume more power, which can impact the overall performance and power consumption of a computer.

Another important aspect of HDDs is their capacity, which is measured in gigabytes (GB) or terabytes (TB). The more data an HDD can store, the more files, documents, photos, and videos can be saved on a computer.

In recent years, solid-state drives (SSDs) have become increasingly popular as an alternative to HDDs. SSDs use flash memory technology to store data and have a number of benefits over the HDD. However, HDDs remain a common and reliable choice for storing large amounts of data at a relatively low cost.

##### SSDs

A solid-state drive (SSD) is a type of internal storage device that is used to store data on a computer. Unlike HDDs, which use spinning disks and read/write heads to access and store data, SSDs use flash memory technology to store data.

Flash memory is a type of non-volatile memory that can retain data even when there is no power source. SSDs consist of multiple flash memory chips that are arranged in a grid-like pattern. When data is written to an SSD, it is stored as electrical charges in the memory chips.

When data is read from an SSD, the electrical charges in the memory chips are detected by a controller chip, which converts the charges into data that can be used by the computer's processor. Because SSDs have no moving parts, they are faster and more reliable than HDDs. They are also less prone to mechanical failures and can withstand more physical shocks and vibrations.

SSDs have several advantages over HDDs. One of the main advantages is their speed. Because SSDs have no moving parts, they can read and write data much faster than HDDs. This results in faster boot times, faster application loading times, and overall faster performance.

Another advantage of SSDs is their durability. Because SSDs have no moving parts, they are less prone to mechanical failures and can withstand more physical shocks and vibrations. This makes them a good choice for laptops and other portable devices that are often subjected to rough handling.

SSDs also consume less power than HDDs, which can result in longer battery life for laptops and other portable devices. They also generate less heat, which can help reduce the overall temperature of a computer and improve its reliability.

However, SSDs also have some disadvantages. One of the main disadvantages is their cost. SSDs are generally more expensive than HDDs, which can make them a less attractive option for users who need a lot of storage space but are on a tight budget. SSDs also have a limited lifespan, as they can only be written to a certain number of times before they begin to degrade. However, this is less of an issue with modern SSDs, which have longer lifespans than earlier models.

### Input and Output:

Input and Output Devices: Input devices are hardware components that allow a user to interact with a computer, such as a keyboard and a mouse. They are used to input data into a computer and frequently used to control the device and for manipulating data. Output devices, on the other hand, are hardware components that allow a computer to display or output information, such as a monitor or a printer. They are used to output data from a computer. Other examples of input and output devices include touchscreens, scanners, and speakers.

#### Barcode and QR Scanners

Barcodes are a series of lines and spaces that represent information about a product or item. Barcodes are used in a wide range of industries, including retail, manufacturing, and healthcare, to help track inventory and improve efficiency.

To read a barcode, a special scanner is used. The scanner emits a beam of light that reflects off the barcode and is detected by a photosensitive element in the scanner. As the scanner moves over the barcode, it detects the varying widths and spaces between the lines, which are then translated into a digital code that can be read and interpreted by a computer.

QR codes, or Quick Response codes, are a type of barcode that can store more information than traditional barcodes. QR codes are square-shaped and consist of black and white squares arranged in a grid pattern. QR codes can be read using a smartphone or a dedicated QR code scanner.

To read a QR code, a smartphone or scanner is used to take a picture of the code. The QR code is then decoded using special software that can read the information encoded in the code. QR codes can store a wide range of information, including URLs, contact information, and product information.

Barcode and QR scanners are used in a variety of ways. In retail, barcode scanners are used at checkout to scan the barcodes on products and record their prices and quantities. In manufacturing, barcode scanners are used to track inventory and monitor production processes. In healthcare, barcode scanners are used to scan patient wristbands and medications to help prevent medication errors.

QR codes are also used in a variety of ways. They can be used in advertising to provide more information about products or services, or to link to a website or social media account. They can also be used in education to provide quick access to online resources or to provide interactive learning experiences.

Document/2D Scanner:

A 2D or document scanner is a type of device that is used to digitize paper documents and images. Unlike a barcode or QR code scanner, which is designed to read specific types of codes, a document scanner is designed to capture the entire image or document and create a digital copy that can be stored, edited, or shared.

There are two main types of document scanners: flatbed scanners and sheet-fed scanners. Flatbed scanners are similar in design to a photocopier and consist of a flat glass surface that the document is placed on, and a scanning element that moves back and forth over the document to capture the image. Sheet-fed scanners, on the other hand, are designed to feed documents through the scanner automatically and capture the image as they pass through.

To use a document scanner, you typically place the document face-down on the scanner bed and align it with the edge of the scanner. You then press the scan button, and the scanner captures the image and creates a digital copy of the document. The scanned image can be saved as a PDF, JPEG, or other file format and can be edited, shared, or stored on a computer or other device.

Document scanners are used in a wide range of industries and applications, including in offices to digitize paper records and documents, in healthcare to capture patient records and medical images, and in education to create digital copies of textbooks and other learning materials.

## Analogue and digital data

Characteristics of analogue data:

- Continuous: Analog data is continuous in nature, meaning it can take on any value within a given range.
- Infinite Resolution: There is no limit to the number of possible values that can be represented in analogue data.

- Susceptible to interference: Analogue signals can be disrupted by noise, interference or other distortions which can result in loss of information or data.

Characteristics of digital data:

- Discrete: Digital data is discrete in nature, meaning it can only take on specific values.
- Finite resolution: There is a limit to the number of possible values that can be represented in digital data.
- Robust: Digital signals are less susceptible to interference, noise, or distortion than analogue signals.

Differences between analogue and digital data:

- Representation: Analogue data is represented by a continuous signal, while digital data is represented by a series of discrete values.
- Processing: Analogue data can be difficult to process, as it requires specialized equipment to convert it into digital form. Digital data, on the other hand, can be easily processed using computers and other digital devices.
- Storage: Analogue data is typically stored on physical media, such as tapes or vinyl records, while digital data can be stored on a variety of media, such as hard drives or cloud storage.
- Quality: Digital data can maintain its quality over time and through multiple reproductions, while analogue data degrades over time and with each reproduction.

In summary, analogue data is continuous and has infinite resolution, while digital data is discrete and has finite resolution. Analogue data is susceptible to interference, while digital data is more robust. Analogue data is represented by a continuous signal, while digital data is represented by a series of discrete values.

**Analogue to digital conversion:**

Many real-world signals such as sound, temperature, light, and pressure are analogue in nature. These signals need to be converted to digital form so that they can be processed by a computer. Digital signals are discrete in nature, consisting of a series of binary values (0's and 1's) that computers can understand and process.

The process of converting analogue signals to digital signals is known as analogue-to-digital conversion (ADC). This process involves sampling the analogue signal at regular intervals and converting each sample into a binary value. The resulting series of binary values can then be stored, manipulated, and analyzed using a computer. The need to convert analogue signals to digital form is crucial in many applications, such as audio and video recording, medical imaging, and scientific research.

**Digital to analogue conversion:**

Digital data can also be converted to analogue signals so that they can be used to control devices such as speakers, motors, and displays. For example, digital audio files need to be converted to analogue signals to be played back through a speaker system. The process of converting digital signals to analogue signals is known as digital-to-analogue conversion (DAC).

DAC involves taking a series of binary values and converting them into a continuous analogue signal. This involves using a digital-to-analogue converter, which uses a set of digital signals to create a corresponding analogue signal. The resulting analogue signal can then be used to control devices that require analogue input.

## Emerging technologies

Emerging technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and extended reality (virtual and augmented), have a significant impact on our lives. They are changing the way we work, communicate, and interact with the world around us.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. AI is being used in various fields, such as healthcare, education, and transportation. For example, AI is used in healthcare to analyze medical images and help diagnose diseases. In education, AI-powered systems are used to personalize learning experiences for students. In transportation, self-driving cars are being developed that use AI to make decisions while driving.

Extended reality (XR) is an umbrella term used to describe virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). VR is a computer-generated simulation that immerses users in a virtual world. AR, on the other hand, overlays digital information onto the real world. Both VR and AR have a significant impact on entertainment and gaming industries. For example, VR is being used to create immersive gaming experiences, while AR is being used to enhance sports broadcasts by overlaying information about the game onto the screen.

One of the significant impacts of emerging technologies is that they are transforming the way we interact with the world around us. For example, virtual and augmented reality are enabling us to experience new things in ways that were not possible before. These technologies are also providing new ways to learn and communicate, which can enhance our understanding of the world.

However, there are also concerns about the impact of emerging technologies on our society. For example, some people worry that AI could lead to job displacement, while others worry about privacy concerns with the use of XR technologies. It is essential to consider both the benefits and risks of emerging technologies as they continue to develop and shape our world.
