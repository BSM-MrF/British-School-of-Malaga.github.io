## User Defined Data Types

### You should already know...

1. Different data types
2. How to select appropriate data types
3. How to write pseudocode
4. What a record is

Programmers use specific data types that perfectly fit the needs of a program. They can create their own data types using basic data types that are already available in the programming language. Sometimes, they also make use of data types they have created earlier in their program. These custom data types are known as user-defined data types. User-defined data types can be divided into two categories: non-composite and composite data types.

### Non-composite Data Types

Non-composite data types in programming are like single puzzle pieces that can hold one specific type of information. They are simple and don't contain multiple pieces or parts.

Imagine you have a box of Lego blocks, and each block represents a non-composite data type. Each block can only hold one piece of information, such as a number, a letter, or a word. For example, if you want to store someone's age, you can use a non-composite data type called "integer." It's like having a special Lego block that can only hold a single number, like 15. Similarly, if you want to store someone's name, you can use a non-composite data type called "string." It's like having another Lego block that can only hold a word or a series of letters, like "Emma" or "John."

Non-composite data types are useful because they allow programmers to work with simple pieces of information and build more complex structures using these basic building blocks.

A non-composite data type doesn't need to rely on another data type for its definition. It can be either a basic type provided by a programming language or a custom type created by the user. Non-composite user-defined data types are typically designed for specific purposes.

Two [Non-composite](/pages/9618/13.1-NonCompTypes.md) types we will look at are:
